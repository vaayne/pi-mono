## [0.49.2] - 2026-01-19

## [0.49.1] - 2026-01-18

### Added

- Added undo support to Editor with Ctrl+- hotkey. Undo coalesces consecutive word characters into one unit (fish-style). ([#831](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/831) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))
- Added legacy terminal support for Ctrl+symbol keys (Ctrl+\, Ctrl+], Ctrl+-) and their Ctrl+Alt variants. ([#831](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/831) by [@Perlence](https://github.com/Perlence))

## [0.49.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added

- Added `showHardwareCursor` getter and setter to control cursor visibility while keeping IME positioning active. ([#800](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/800) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Changed

- Hardware cursor is now disabled by default for better terminal compatibility. Set `PI_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` to enable (replaces `PI_NO_HARDWARE_CURSOR=1` which disabled it).

### Fixed

- Decode Kitty CSI-u printable sequences in the editor so shifted symbol keys (e.g., `@`, `?`) work in terminals that enable Kitty keyboard protocol ([#779](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/779) by [@iamd3vil](https://github.com/iamd3vil))

## [0.47.0] - 2026-01-16

### Breaking Changes

- `Editor` constructor now requires `TUI` as first parameter: `new Editor(tui, theme)`. This enables automatic vertical scrolling when content exceeds terminal height. ([#732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/732))

### Added

- Hardware cursor positioning for IME support in `Editor` and `Input` components. The terminal cursor now follows the text cursor position, enabling proper IME candidate window placement for CJK input. ([#719](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/719))
- `Focusable` interface for components that need hardware cursor positioning. Implement `focused: boolean` and emit `CURSOR_MARKER` in render output when focused.
- `CURSOR_MARKER` constant and `isFocusable()` type guard exported from the package
- Editor now supports Page Up/Down keys (Fn+Up/Down on MacBook) for scrolling through large content ([#732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/732))
- Expanded keymap coverage for terminal compatibility: added support for Home/End keys in tmux, additional modifier combinations, and improved key sequence parsing ([#752](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/752) by [@richardgill](https://github.com/richardgill))

### Fixed

- Editor no longer corrupts terminal display when text exceeds screen height. Content now scrolls vertically with indicators showing lines above/below the viewport. Max height is 30% of terminal (minimum 5 lines). ([#732](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/732))
- `visibleWidth()` and `extractAnsiCode()` now handle APC escape sequences (`ESC _ ... BEL`), fixing width calculation and string slicing for strings containing cursor markers
- SelectList now handles multi-line descriptions by replacing newlines with spaces ([#728](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/728) by [@richardgill](https://github.com/richardgill))

## [0.46.0] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, etc.) now work on non-Latin keyboard layouts (Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, etc.) in terminals supporting Kitty keyboard protocol with alternate key reporting ([#718](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/718) by [@dannote](https://github.com/dannote))

## [0.45.6] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- `OverlayOptions` API for overlay positioning and sizing with CSS-like values: `width`, `maxHeight`, `row`, `col` accept numbers (absolute) or percentage strings (e.g., `"50%"`). Also supports `minWidth`, `anchor`, `offsetX`, `offsetY`, `margin`. ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- `OverlayOptions.visible` callback for responsive overlays - receives terminal dimensions, return false to hide ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- `showOverlay()` now returns `OverlayHandle` with `hide()`, `setHidden(boolean)`, `isHidden()` for programmatic visibility control ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- New exported types: `OverlayAnchor`, `OverlayHandle`, `OverlayMargin`, `OverlayOptions`, `SizeValue` ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))
- `truncateToWidth()` now accepts optional `pad` parameter to pad result with spaces to exactly `maxWidth` ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

### Fixed

- Overlay compositing crash when rendered lines exceed terminal width due to complex ANSI/OSC sequences (e.g., hyperlinks in subagent output) ([#667](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/667) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-05

## [0.35.0] - 2026-01-05

## [0.34.2] - 2026-01-04

## [0.34.1] - 2026-01-04

## [0.33.0] - 2026-01-04

### Breaking Changes

- **Key detection functions removed**: All `isXxx()` key detection functions (`isEnter()`, `isEscape()`, `isCtrlC()`, etc.) have been removed. Use `matchesKey(data, keyId)` instead (e.g., `matchesKey(data, "enter")`, `matchesKey(data, "ctrl+c")`). This affects hooks and custom tools that use `ctx.ui.custom()` with keyboard input handling. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405))

### Added

- `Editor.insertTextAtCursor(text)` method for programmatic text insertion ([#419](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/419))
- `EditorKeybindingsManager` for configurable editor keybindings. Components now use `matchesKey()` and keybindings manager instead of individual `isXxx()` functions. ([#405](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/405) by [@hjanuschka](https://github.com/hjanuschka))

### Changed

- Key detection refactored: consolidated `is*()` functions into generic `matchesKey(data, keyId)` function that accepts key identifiers like `"ctrl+c"`, `"shift+enter"`, `"alt+left"`, etc.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.2] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Slash command autocomplete now triggers for commands starting with `.`, `-`, or `_` (e.g., `/.land`, `/-foo`) ([#422](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/422))

## [0.32.1] - 2026-01-03

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Shift+Space, Shift+Backspace, and Shift+Delete now work correctly in Kitty-protocol terminals (Kitty, WezTerm, etc.) instead of being silently ignored ([#411](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/411) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.31.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- `visibleWidth()` now strips OSC 8 hyperlink sequences, fixing text wrapping for clickable links ([#396](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/396) by [@Cursivez](https://github.com/Cursivez))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- `isShiftCtrlO()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+O (Kitty protocol)
- `isShiftCtrlD()` key detection function for Shift+Ctrl+D (Kitty protocol)
- `TUI.onDebug` callback for global debug key handling (Shift+Ctrl+D)
- `wrapTextWithAnsi()` utility now exported (wraps text to width, preserving ANSI codes)

### Changed

- README.md completely rewritten with accurate component documentation, theme interfaces, and examples
- `visibleWidth()` reimplemented with grapheme-based width calculation, 10x faster on Bun and ~15% faster on Node ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

### Fixed

- Markdown component now renders HTML tags as plain text instead of silently dropping them ([#359](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/359))
- Crash in `visibleWidth()` and grapheme iteration when encountering undefined code points ([#372](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/372) by [@HACKE-RC](https://github.com/HACKE-RC))
- ZWJ emoji sequences (rainbow flag, family, etc.) now render with correct width instead of being split into multiple characters ([#369](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/369) by [@nathyong](https://github.com/nathyong))

## [0.29.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Auto-space before pasted file paths**: When pasting a file path (starting with `/`, `~`, or `.`) and the cursor is after a word character, a space is automatically prepended for better readability. Useful when dragging screenshots from macOS. ([#307](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/307) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))
- **Word navigation for Input component**: Added Ctrl+Left/Right and Alt+Left/Right support for word-by-word cursor movement. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
- **Full Unicode input**: Input component now accepts Unicode characters beyond ASCII. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- **Readline-style Ctrl+W**: Now skips trailing whitespace before deleting the preceding word, matching standard readline behavior. ([#306](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/306) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))
